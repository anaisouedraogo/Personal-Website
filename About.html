        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>

             I studied for two years in India at Mahindra United World College of India, where I got a bilingual International Baccalaureate (IB) in 2019. In addition to my educational experience, I am part of student organizations such as the Price College JCPenney Leadership Program, a highly selective program that focuses on professional skills development

            My classmates and instructors describe me as being a hard-working, respectful, and open-minded student. I will be graduating in May 2023, and I would like to work in a diverse environment where I can interact with different types of people with whom I can share and learn new skills.

            According to Gallup StrengthsFinder 2.0, my top five strengths are:
           Harmony
            Achiever
             Deliberative
             Consistency
           and Restorative
